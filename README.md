# Customer Churn

## Introduction

In this notebook we will analyze and predict, with machine learning models, customer churn.

*Customer churn* is the **measure of how many customers stop using a product.**

Why is customer churn so important for a company to analyze?

1. It is estimated that acquiring a new customer can cost up to **five times more** than retaining an existing one.
2. Unhappy customers are more likely to **speak negatively** and therefore **harm your brand.**


In this **supervised binary classification** exercise, we want to determine if customers will stop using a company's products or services or will remain in the same company.

**What Is Churn Rate?**

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. It is also the rate at which employees leave their jobs within a certain period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate (measured by the number of new customers) must exceed its churn rate.
